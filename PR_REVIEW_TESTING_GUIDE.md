# PR Review Testing Guide

## 🎯 **Why Spelling Comments Aren't Appearing**

The spelling comments aren't appearing because **no pull request has been created** for your branch. The GitHub Actions workflow only runs when a pull request is opened.

## 🔧 **How to Test the PR Review System**

### **Step 1: Create a Pull Request**

1. **Go to GitHub** and navigate to your repository
2. **Click "Compare & pull request"** for the `feat/intentinal-mist` branch
3. **Create the PR** with a title like "Test: Intentional spelling mistakes for PR review testing"

### **Step 2: Check GitHub Actions**

1. **Go to the "Actions" tab** in your GitHub repository
2. **Look for "Automated PR Review"** workflow
3. **Check if it's running** and view the logs

### **Step 3: Verify the Results**

1. **Go to the PR** and check the "Files changed" tab
2. **Look for inline comments** on lines with spelling mistakes:
   - Line with `"Elctronics"` → should suggest `"Electronics"`
   - Line with `"Fshion"` → should suggest `"Fashion"`
   - Line with `"Shp"` → should suggest `"Shop"`
   - Line with `addTCart` → should suggest `addToCart`

## 🧪 **Local Testing (Already Working)**

The local tests confirm that the spelling detection logic is working:

```bash
# Test spelling detection logic
node test-spelling-only.js

# Expected output:
✅ Found 'Elctronics' on line 2
✅ Found 'Fshion' on line 2
✅ Found 'Shp' on line 20
✅ Found 'addTCart' on line 10
```

## 🔍 **What the PR Review Script Does**

1. **Extracts identifiers** from changed files (variables, functions, strings)
2. **Sends them to OpenAI** for spelling analysis
3. **Finds line numbers** where misspelled identifiers appear
4. **Creates inline comments** on those specific lines
5. **Posts the review** to GitHub

## 🚨 **Common Issues**

### **Issue 1: No PR Created**

- **Solution**: Create a pull request for your branch

### **Issue 2: Workflow Not Running**

- **Check**: Go to Actions tab and look for "Automated PR Review"
- **Solution**: Ensure the workflow file is in the main branch

### **Issue 3: Missing Environment Variables**

- **Check**: Workflow logs for "Bad credentials" errors
- **Solution**: Ensure `OPENAI_API_KEY` is set in repository secrets

### **Issue 4: Comments Not Appearing**

- **Check**: Workflow logs for successful API calls
- **Solution**: Look for "📝 Posted review with X file/line comments" in logs

## 📋 **Expected Workflow Logs**

When working correctly, you should see:

```
🔍 Reviewing PR #X in owner/repo...
🔤 Checking spelling in src/app/shop/page.tsx...
  Found 8 identifiers: Elctronics, Fshion, Shp, addTCart...
🔤 Found 4 spelling issues in src/app/shop/page.tsx
  Issues: Elctronics → Electronics, Fshion → Fashion, Shp → Shop, addTCart → addToCart
🔤 Adding spelling comment for 'Elctronics' on line 95
📍 Found 'Elctronics' on line 95 in src/app/shop/page.tsx
📝 Added spelling comment for src/app/shop/page.tsx:95
📝 Posted review with 0 summary comments and 4 file/line comments.
```

## 🎯 **Next Steps**

1. **Create a pull request** for your `feat/intentinal-mist` branch
2. **Check the Actions tab** to see if the workflow runs
3. **Look for inline comments** in the PR Files changed tab
4. **If issues persist**, check the workflow logs for errors

The spelling detection logic is working perfectly - you just need to create a PR to trigger the GitHub Actions workflow!
